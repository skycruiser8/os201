## Background

This site is part of a collective project initiated by [the lecturer](https://github.com/rms46/) of Operating Systems (CSGE602055) course in Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia for the 2019/2020 Even Semester. Some of the terminal goals expected to be gained from this site include but not limited to:

1. Share knowledge on the topic of Operating Systems publicly.
2. Assist in the collection and development of a more comprehensive Operating Systems knowledge base.
3. *And other goals found along the way...*

The author also hope that this site can be used to assist future participants of the Operating Systems course on gaining additional knowledge regarding the aforementioned course.



## About the Author

Rafi Muhammad Daffa ([GitHub: skycruiser8](https://github.com/skycruiser8/))

A student who, at the time of this site's initial deployment, is attending the Operating Systems (CSGE602055) course in Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia.

I am interested in the topics of Knowledge Management, Software Engineering, and Distance Learning.

One of my reasons to develop this site is related to my interest on knowledge management.
