# Operating Systems URL Starter Pack

This page is used to share URLs to sites that I personally often use throughout the Operating Systems course.



## Lecturer's Resource

The following URLs refer to sites made by [the lecturer](https://github.com/rms46/) of Operating Systems (CSGE602055) course in Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia for the 2019/2020 Even Semester. These sites mostly publishes information for specific use of the course but some resource may be useful for the general public.

## Learn Bash

First of all, this course will involve significant interaction with the Linux ecosystem and Bash is one of the main dependencies of the course. Therefore, Bash scripting language material is allocated on the first week of the course (as of the 2019/2020 Even Semester). For starters, these resources may be helpful:
