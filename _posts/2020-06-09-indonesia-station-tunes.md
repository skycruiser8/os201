# [OUT-OF-TOPIC] Indonesia's Station Tunes

In an effort to foster unique identities for each operational area (Indonesian: Daerah Operasi) under Indonesian Railways Company (Indonesian: PT. Kereta Api Indonesia), each operational area assigns one or more songs to be their "station tune" which is play whenever a long-distance train arrives in the station.

Here are some of the songs that I personally prefer:

1. Kicir-Kicir (Operational Area 1 Jakarta)
2. Sabilulungan (Operational Area 2 Bandung)
3. Kota Cirebon (Operational Area 3 Cirebon)
4. Gambang Semarang (Operational Area 4 Semarang)
5. Nasi Pecel Madiun (Operational Area 7 Madiun)

Oh, usually smaller stations will adopt a more generic tune, called Westminster Chime in place of their assigned station tunes. This is the case for KRL stations which is not shared with long-distance trains.
